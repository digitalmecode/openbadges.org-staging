From 2014-2015, the Cities Working Group connected badge systems across other networks, including the national Cities of Learning brand. This city-wide initiative created linkages  between in-classroom learning and out-of-school learning experiences for youth to explore new interests and gain real-world job skills. The members leveraged badge systems across networks and cities to create a more connected, richer learning network for learners to tap into.
