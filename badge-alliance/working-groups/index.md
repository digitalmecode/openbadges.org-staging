The success of the open badging ecosystem goes beyond the technical maintenance of the Open Badges Infrastructure and the ongoing stewardship of the Open Badge Specification. 

<h2 class="title title-content">The Badge Alliance Works in Groups</h2>
The BA works in groups, comprised of action-oriented teams of volunteers. Each working group is focused on a specific topic and is chaired by an individual or organization leading efforts in the wider community. Members address key questions, issues, and opportunities facing the Open Badges ecosystem and infrastructure for documenting and credentialing learning. 

When the Badge Alliance soft-launched at the Summit to Reconnect Learning, 10 initial working groups were formed to address some of the most crucial issues facing the broader infrastructure for the Open Badges ecosystem. These groups completed their first cycle in October 2014, delivering completed reports and survey data in their field. A second cycle in 2015 focused on delivering v1.1 of the Open Badges Specification, and a third cycle is beginning in the lead-up to the summer 2016 v2.0 specification release.

Currently, groups operate on a short-term basis as they’re needed, strive for broad representation across the globe, and are one of the primary means by which the Open Badges ecosystem work is advanced. Details on current and past working groups can be found here.

<h2 class="title title-content" id="operations">Operations and Communication Channels</h2>
Most working groups hold a conference call every other week, where the chair/cabinet gathers feedback from the participants on important proposals, plans, and deliverables related to the group’s goals. In between meetings, the broader working group community can weigh in on these and other issues asynchronously in the working group forums and mailing lists.

The weekly schedule of working group calls is available on the BA [calendar](../events). The chairs of all active working groups meet with the BA team to discuss overlaps and connections across working groups, as well as consider best practices and challenges facing the groups.
Structure of Working Groups
Each working group includes a:

* Chair - Representative of the organization leading the working group’s conversations.
* Cabinet (optional) - Individuals responsible for setting the group’s initial goals, strategy, and roadmap. Some working groups may not need a cabinet as this work may be done by the chair.
* Badge Alliance Liaison - Dedicated member of the BA team who works with the chair/cabinet to analyze feedback from the broader community, draft proposed plans, track the work, and recruit working group members from other organizations.

An individual Badge Alliance member or representative of a BA member organization serves as chair. With the assistance of the BA staff and other community members, the chair organizes synchronous meetings, sets the agenda, and pursues goals. The outcomes of Badge Alliance working groups are openly published for the benefit of the entire Open Badges community.
