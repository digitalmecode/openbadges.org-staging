The Open Badges ecosystem is built on an open specification implemented by many applications and services. This open structure allows different issuers, earners, and consumers to freely use available resources and contribute to the work.  Effective January 1, 2017, the Open Badges Specification, will continue to evolve under the stewardship of [IMS Global Learning Consortium](https://www.imsglobal.org/), who will provide ongoing open governance with inputs from the community.

<h2 class="title title-content" id="open-source">Open Source Issuing Software</h2>
A number of the above issuing platforms have released the underlying code as open source software. This allows partners to collaborate on the applications themselves, increase control over operations, and potentially reduce costs paid for subscription services. The tradeoff is that issuers who host their own platforms take on the responibility for maintaining the badges for their useful lives. 

**Standalone Badge Issuers**:

* BadgeKit: Currently unmaintained open source Issuing platform published by Mozilla: See [openbadges-badgekit](https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges-badgekit) and [badgekit-api](https://github.com/mozilla/badgekit-api)
* [Badgr](#Badgr): Issuer platform and Backpack service available open source from Concentric Sky: [Badgr-server](https://github.com/concentricsky/badgr-server)

**Open Source Plugins and Integrations**:

* [BadgeOS™](#BadgeOS): Open source plugin for the WordPress platform that integrates with Credly's Open Credit API. Published by Learning Times, the makers of Credly: [BadgeOS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/badgeos/)
* [BadgeSafe](#BadgeSafe): The source code for the BadgeSafe server that integrates with the Canvas LMS is available upon request.
* [Moodle](#Moodle): The Open Source Learning Management System includes Open Badges awarding within courses. See: [Moodle](https://download.moodle.org/)



<h2 class="title title-content" id="backpacks">Backpack Services</h2>
Open Badges may be baked into image files that can be posted anywhere on the web, but in order to unlock their metadata and verification status, it's necessary to use an application that understands the Open Badges specification as part of the process. Badge recipients use Backpack services to store their badges and share them so that the consumers of these badges can understand that they are more than a simple image file. There are at least three compatible Open Badges Backpack services available.

Each Backpack service that appears in this list allows users to upload Open Badges they have earned from any Issuer and share displays of those badges with others. Additionally, the developers of each of these solutions regularly consult with other Badge Alliance members to advance the concept of an Open Badges Backpack Service and ensure core features remain in sync across the ecosystem.

**Open Badges Backpack Services**:

* [Mozilla Backpack](https://backpack.openbadges.org) - collects, manages, and displays badges from multiple sources anywhere on the web. Also available open source from Mozilla: [openbadges-backpack].
* [Open Badge Passport](https://openbadgepassport.com/) - a free, easy to use service, where you can receive and store your Open Badges safely and share them with whomever you like and wherever you like. Open source code is released by Discendum: [Salava](https://github.com/discendum/salava)
* [Badgr](https://info.badgr.io) - an open-source badge issuing, management, and user achievement tracking platform. Hosted accounts are free on badgr.io. Open source code is released by Concentric Sky: [Badgr-server](https://github.com/concentricsky/badgr-server).

<h2 class="title title-content" id="other-services">Other Services</h2>
There are several other functions around Open Badges discovery that help wire the ecosystem together. 

* [Badge Alliance Directory Prototype](https://badgealliance.github.io/openbadges-directory/) - This Open Badges storage and retrieval system is an open source community project, whereby any Issuer of Open Badges can register to have them indexed.
* [Credmos](https://credmos.com/) - Finds Open Badges that recognize learning, achievements, competencies, or credentials to earn with its search box or tag cloud.
