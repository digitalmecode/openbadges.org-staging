The Badge Alliance aims to publish a set of up-to-date resources that help community members understand badges well. We welcome [contributions](https://github.com/openbadges/openbadges.org-static/blob/gh-pages/about/resources/index.md) to this library, just submit a pull request.

<h2 class="title title-content" id="definition">What’s an Open Badge?</h2>
A “digital badge” is a visual symbol of recognition represented by a digital image file. Open Badges are portable and verifiable digital badges that comply with the Open Badges Specification, which defines a mechanism to embed specific metadata about educational achievements into digital badges. Open Badges can represent online and offline accomplishments, experiences, and skills from formal and informal settings. Each Open Badge is associated with an image and metadata, which provides information about the badge, its Recipient, the Issuer, and any applicable supporting evidence.

<h3 class="title title-secondary">What do badges mean?</h3>
Badges may represent many different types of achievements and trust relationships:

* Hard skills such as proficiency in a programming language
* Soft skills like collaboration
* Participation
* Official certification
* Authorization 
* Community involvement
* New skills and literacies not recognized by traditional education providers

Open Badges allow you to verify your achievements, competencies, and interests through credible organizations. This information is attached to a badge image file, hard-coding the metadata for future access and review.
 
Because the system is based on an open standard, Recipients can combine multiple badges from different Issuers to tell the complete story of their verifiable achievements—both online and off. These web-enabled tokens can be displayed wherever Recipients want them on the web, including social media and badge Backpacks. Badges can be shared for employment, education, or lifelong learning.

Anyone can Issue a badge, receive one, verify that a badge is real, or see the detailed evidence from the Issuer. Badges can be used to set goals, motivate behaviors, connect learning environments, and communicate success in many contexts. 

<h2 class="title title-content" id="resources">Community Resources</h2>
Open Badges started as a collaborative project between the MacArthur Foundation and the Mozilla Foundation and has continued to grow through an open, collaborative community of implementers. It’s designed, built, and backed by a broad community of contributors. Much of the software that implements Open Badges is available as open source. See a list of available [tools and services »]({{ site.baseurl}}/about/participating-services).

The open specification means improvements are created through a multi-stakeholder perspective, where values like user choice and privacy are maintained as core features of the ecosystem. 

The Open Badges project at the Mozilla Foundation kicked off with the [Open Badges Working Paper by Erin Knight (PDF)](https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/59/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_012312.pdf), in collaboration with Peer 2 Peer University. It sketches out the promise of an open ecosystem of verifiable digital learning credentials.

[Badge the World](http://www.badgetheworld.org/) - this global effort began at MozFest 2013 as a way to document innovative projects involving Open Badges. In 2014, the European Union supported Badge the World through the Erasmus + funded Open Badge Network, which aims to build an Open Badge Network across Europe. Today, Badge the World provides an inventory of European badging efforts.

[Badges in Action](http://www.reconnectlearning.org/case-studies) - A set of case studies looking at how badges are used to capture learning and achievements in higher education, professional training, and after-school programs. 

[10 Million Better Futures](http://www.10mbetterfutures.org) - This Clinton Global Initiative aimed to help 10 million workers and students succeed using Open Badges by 2016. #BadgeChatK12 co-founder Noah Geisel joined leaders in the initiative’s commitment to unlock two million better futures with digital badges. 

[Cities of Learning / LRNG](https://www.lrng.org/) - The first citywide badging initiative, launched in Chicago in 2013, was so successful that six cities launched badge systems for learning in 2014. Eight cities were named winners in the 2016 LRNG City Challenge, receiving grants to begin networking learning opportunities in their communities.
